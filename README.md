As we all know, the value of digital currencies has been spiraling since the early development of blockchain. Funds in digital form may
now worth hundred or even thousand times more compared to what they were only a few years ago. Although its value is not to be doubted
nowadays, it was so often overlooked that many people have already forgotten the associated passwords. The outcome is detrimental, as
people face the situation where their digital funds cannot be claimed. However, due to the increase of the value in digital currencies,
it is now worth money and effort to get passwords back; as more and more customers are involved in digital funds transactions, the need
for a service that can help people to recover their forgotten password has also increased greatly. However, due to the decentralization
characteristic, more and more digital funds are lost permanently, resulting in a great economic loss，it's like forgetting a bank account
password, but there's no bank to call to reset it.

Bitcoin Recovery was founded based on a passion for Cryptocurrency, and a love for technology. But also because one of our founders
accidentally lost the password to their wallet. Oops! So the other founder helped build a tool that would recover this wallet.
We instantly knew that other people out there may face the same issue. People who’ve lost their password without the ability to get to
their coins. It is an advanced and extremely fast passwords recovery tool for encrypted bitcoin wallets，we have created a highly
optimized multi-threaded program to perform the brute-force decryption，and if you have a vague idea of your password, but can’t quite
remember it，then we can help you.


MANUAL FOR VERSION 1.0

1. In your default folder for bitcoin core software (or other cryptocurrencies which based on Bitcoin), find "wallet.dat" document.
2. Make a copy of the wallet document you found -- this will be your copy for password testing.
3. Open BitcoinRecovery, click on "……" button under Wallet File Path to select the copy you just made. Under Currency, type in the type
    of currency you use (eg. bitcoin). For Wallet Address, please copy your wallet address and paste it here.
4. Click advanced setting, and you will be able to personalize your search in 4 ways:
1) Possible number of password:
If you remember clearly the number of characters in your password, go ahead and put it in your "Possible Number of Passwords" section.
If you don't, we suggest you try all possible numbers in later runs.

Important: Do hit the confirm button when you are done.

2) Accurate character(s):
Here, you can:

a) click one or more specific positions among the combination array
b) type in any character that you recall to be on it.
Again, we suggest you only type in characters that you are most certain of, for if this is not the case, the process can be interfered.

3) Character Filtering:
To better understand how our character filtering system works, you can picture it in three layers:

1st: Without any input in character filtering the system assumes all letters and numbers are included in the testing pool by default
    (very important, symbols are not included). This can generate a huge list of possible password for testing and the time needed for
    decryption can thus be drastically long.
2nd: By making any categorical selection, i.e., ticking All uppercase, All lowercase, All Digital or All Symbol, the default range has
    changed to selected categories only. For example, if you select All lowercase and All Digital, only lowercase letters or digital numbers
    will be used to generate testing combinations.
3rd: Making any changes in further customization section, i.e., Uppercase custom, Lowercase custom, Digital custom and Symbol custom, it
    will give BitcoinRecovery a more precise range for generating possible passwords.
    a) All Uppercase, All Lower case, All Digital and All Symbol
    Check a category if you want to include all characters that are classified under category.

b) Uppercase custom, Lowercase custom, Digital Custom and Symbol custom
You can further customize your setting here by selecting any letters or numbers you remember existing in your password to narrow down the
range of selected characters.

! Important: You will need to manually select any symbols, as all symbols are opted out by default.

4) Final Check:
After you click OK, your personalized setting will appear on the lower right section that says Keyword setting information for you to check.

5. Click OK button to start your decryption and the time estimation for completing this round will appear on the window.
! Important: The right password combination is assumed to be the last combination listed in the testing array, which is generally does not
exist，so the actual decryption process may take much shorter than it appears as for the estimation

Decryption process stops after the software declares a combination of characters to be the "right" password. A notification says:
Congratulations! Your password has been recovered. You can retrieve it by contacting BitcoinRecovery team. For more detailed instructions
please visit http://recovermybtc.com should appear on your computer screen.
! Important: If decryption stops for any reason without offering a password, we suggest you go back and check your settings. If the
problem still persists, you can contact us with a screenshot.

At the same time, you should be auto-directed to a folder containing a file named decryptresult_time (For example, if your password was
recovered on 2018.02.05 09.26.39am, the file name should be decryptresult_2018.02.05 09.26.39). If not, you can manually locate it within
your BitcoinDecryptTool folder. This file is your Decryption Document. Please hold on to it for later use.

After a brief moment of excitement, please do not forget to contact us and retrieve your password, retrieving process can be found in
this article.

Warning:

Remember to copy your wallet.dat file for two reasons:

1. Our software decrypts directly against your wallet document; therefore, if no copy is made and BitcoinRecovery extracts info from
original wallet document, you might not be able to open Bitcoin Core software (or other core software for cryptocurrencies based on
Bitcoin).
2. This is always a good idea as you do not want any damage to happen to your wallet document as it may cost you permanent loss of bitcoins,
litecoins or other cryptocurrencies.
